*"The Smart Emission Data Platform assembles, processes and unlocks sensor data for* 
*Air Quality, Sound, and Meteo from citizen-based sensor networks."* 

This repository contains sources and documentation for 

* (raw) sensor data publication (push) and acquisition (pull/harvesting)
* raw sensor data processing (validation, calibration, aggregation, ETL)
* unlocking sensor data as Open Data via standardized (OGC) web-APIs (WMS, WFS, SOS, SensorThings API)

**Home page** for this Data Platform is: http://data.smartemission.nl 

The SE Data Platform originates from the **Smart Emission Nijmegen project** (2015+).
The landing page for that project is http://smartemission.nl.

**Documentation** for the Smartemission Data Platform is generated from this repo and
