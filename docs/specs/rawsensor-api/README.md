# Whale API

This is the Smart Emission Raw Sensor REST API, also known as the Whale API.

Via this API the SE Harvesters pull in data from Data Collectors.
This custom Web API was developed (by Robert Kieboom and Just van den Broecke)
specifically for the SE Platform.

See [rawsensor-api.txt](rawsensor-api.txt) for the full specification document. 

The .json files show example output from the REST services.

The Whale API has two main data-services:

- fetch timeseries (history) data of a device
- fetch latest data of any device
