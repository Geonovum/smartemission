Web Services
============

This chapter describes how various OGC OWS web services are realized on top of the
converted/transformed data as described in the `data chapter <data.html>`_.
In particular:

* WFS and WMS-Time services
* OWS SOS (REST) service
* SensorThings API

Architecture
============

Figure 1 sketches the overall architecture with emphasis on the flow of data (arrows).
Circles depict harvesting/ETL processes. Server-instances are in rectangles. Datastores

SOS Services
============

*"The OGC Sensor Observation Service aggregates readings from live, in-situ and remote sensors.*
*The service provides an interface to make sensors and sensor data archives accessible via an*
*interoperable web based interface."*

The chapter on server administration describes how the SOS is deployed. This is
called here the 'SOS Server'.
