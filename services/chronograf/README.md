# Chronograf Service

Chronograf is used to maintain/visualize data from InfluxDB.

> Versions 1.3+ of InfluxDB and InfluxEnterprise no longer support the web admin interface, 
> the builtin user interface for writing and querying data in InfluxDB. 
> Chronograf replaces the web admin interface with improved tooling for querying data, 
> writing data, and database management.

> Chronograf is the user interface component of 
> InfluxDataâ€™s TICK stack. It makes owning the monitoring and alerting for your infrastructure easy to 
> setup and maintain.
